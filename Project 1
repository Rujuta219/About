'''
In this program, we need to take the input as the number of rods.
The output must be the input as well as the conversions made on that number.
The minutes to walk is also computed in this program.
Variables defined are meters,feet,furlongs,miles,min_wrods,rods_float.
All of the variables are printed except the string variable of rods_float.

#No header files were needed


#Inputting the number of rods and printing the input
rods=input("Input rods: ")
rods_float=float(rods)    #conversion from a string to a float
print("You input "+str(rods_float)+" rods.") 

#Converting the rods into other units using mathematical formulae
print("Conversions")
meters=5.0292*rods_float

#printing meters and rounding the answer to 3 decimal places
print("Meters: "+str(round(meters,3)))
feet=meters/0.3048

#printing feet and rounding the answer to 3 decimal places
print("Feet: "+str(round(feet,3)))
miles=meters/1609.34

#printing miles and rounding the answer to 3 decimal places
print("Miles: "+str(round(miles,3)))
furlongs=rods_float/40

#printing furlongs and rounding the answer to 3 decimal places
print("Furlongs: "+str(round(furlongs,3)))

#Finding the minutes to walk using average walking speed i.e. 3.1miles/hr
min_w=60*miles/3.1
print("Minutes to walk "+str(rods_float)+" rods: "+str(round(min_w,3)))
#END of the program
